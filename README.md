# Cybersecurity Writeups
In this repository I will collect all the writeups of the **public cybersecurity challenges** (CTFs, TryHackMe rooms, HackTheBox boxes, etc.) that I solve for work or fun. They will describe my personal approach to the problem, all the steps that I took to get the solution and the reasons behind them.
